# SCHOLARSHIP-PORTAL
## PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Designed, modeled and created a prototype for scholarship portal used by Ministry of Education, India. The database designed is used to 
represent the scholarship portal by the Ministry of Education in India to provide the platform to make 
the scholarship schemes available to students.

## Process Flow 

<b>1. Scholarship schemes published:</b> The database designed would have the Ministry admin to publish the scholarship schemes details and also 
the various prerequisite to avail the scholarship scheme. (database would have the list of schemes and its corresponding details) <br>
<b>2. Student application form:</b> The student would be able to request the scholarship if they meet the prerequisite and submit an application 
with an application ID. (The database would have the student and the application details) <br>
<b>3. Institute:</b>  The database would also have the details of the school authorities which will verify the corresponding records of the submitted 
application as to verify if they have studied in the respective school.(The database would have the school user details, school details in 
various districts and the corresponding student application ID to be verified)<br>
<b>4. Nodal office:</b>  There would also be users at the district level to verify that the prerequisite are met and would update the 
application depending on the criteria as student background and poverty level.(The database here would have the student details in the 
application form and the list of students fitting the criteria would be selected)<br>

## Concepts Covered:
